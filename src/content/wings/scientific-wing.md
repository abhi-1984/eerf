We are dedicated to promoting scientific innovation and understanding through research, education, and experimentation.

To achieve this goal, we have established scientific research centers to develop new technologies and methods to simplify daily life. We also have online and offline platforms for school and college students to conduct experiments and foster a spirit of innovation.

In addition to these efforts, we hold workshops, trainings, and other activities for schools, colleges, educational institutions, and other groups to raise awareness about these innovations and technologies. We also organize quiz competitions and workshops for people of all ages to develop a scientific approach to life.

Furthermore, we believe that science and spirituality can work together to create positive and constructive results, and we hold conferences to explore this intersection.

We hope you will join us in our efforts to promote science and innovation for the benefit of all. All of our activities, as well as those organized by other organizations, will be digitized for easy access.
