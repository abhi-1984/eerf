We are dedicated to understanding and improving the external and internal environmental conditions that impact human beings, other creatures, and nature.

To achieve this goal, we have established research centers to study these conditions and their effects. We also hold events, conferences and exhibitions to raise awareness about environmental issues and the steps we can take to maintain a healthy and clean environment.

In addition to these efforts, we hold workshops, discourses, and lectures for various audiences, including schools, colleges, educational institutions, the corporate world, and housing societies. Our goal is to educate and inspire people to take action to protect the environment and improve their own inner environmental conditions.

To further support this goal, we offer workshops and other activities that use both ancient and modern techniques to improve inner environmental conditions on the physical, mental, intellectual, and psychological levels.

We hope you will join us in our efforts to create a more sustainable and harmonious world. All of our activities, as well as those organized by other organizations, will be digitized for easy access.
