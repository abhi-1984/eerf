We are committed to understanding and promoting social and environmental awareness and sustainability.

To this end, we have established a research center to create an exclusive database of information on every region of the world, which we have digitized for easy access.

We also have study centers dedicated to the lives and work of social reformers and the impact they have had on society. Based on our research, we plan and organize workshops to create social awareness in various regions.

In addition to these efforts, we believe in the power of experiential learning and offer social tours for people of all ages to experience the beauty of nature and exchange knowledge with others. We also hold conferences to share opportunities and work together to improve living standards in different regions.

Finally, we offer workshops and other activities to enrich and improve the physical, mental, intellectual, and psychological well-being of individuals, with the goal of helping them become nature lovers and socially responsible citizens of the world.

We hope you will join us in our efforts to create a more sustainable and aware society. All of our activities, as well as those organized by other organizations, will be digitized for easy access.
