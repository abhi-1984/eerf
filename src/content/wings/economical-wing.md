We are dedicated to studying and understanding the various spiritual paths and teachings of saints from around the world.

We have established research centers focused specifically on these topics, and we also hold workshops and conferences for followers of different spiritual traditions to come together and build a universal spiritual community.

Our goal is to promote peace and understanding within society through our activities and conferences. In addition, we are working to digitize all of our events, as well as those organized by other organizations, in order to make them more accessible to a wider audience.

We invite you to join us on this journey of spiritual exploration and growth. Together, we can create a more peaceful and harmonious world.
